# Route-specific Links

👨‍💼 Hey again. We've got some styles that we _only_ need applied to the homepage.
We can't put them in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> otherwise they would be
loaded on every page and that's just a waste because we don't want them on other
routes.

The homepage code is on <InlineFile file="app/routes/index.tsx" /> and the
styles are right next to it in <InlineFile file="app/routes/index.css" />. Can
you get that CSS file to be loaded on the homepage, but not the others? You'll
know you got it when the numbers under the heading "Nobody's better at rockets
than Rocket Rental" are nice and colorful.

Double check that when you're on <LinkToApp to="/login" /> the styles aren't on
the page. You can check the network tab, or watch the `<head>` where the
`<link>` should be added/removed when you transition between the homepage and
the login page.

🦉 Remember, each route file (like <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> and all
the files in `app/routes`) can export a `links` function. Not just the root
route. And those links will be on the page when that route is on the page.
Moreover, it'll even be removed when that route is not active as well.
