# PostCSS and Tailwind CSS Support

👨‍💼 We already have a <InlineFile file="postcss.config.js" /> file which
configures PostCSS to use Tailwind CSS and <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.js" />
file which configures Tailwind CSS. And we've already got a bunch of Tailwind
classes in the code. So all we need to do is add a `<link>` for <InlineFile file="app/styles/tailwind.css" />
which uses the Tailwind directives to generate the CSS based on our usage of the
tailwind classes.

And we definitely want this on every page, so it's back to the <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />
file! Pretty sure for this one, it'll be obvious when you are successful 😅 But
if you're unsure, pop open the network tab and look for the tailwind.css file
with the fingerprint hash in the filename.
